# RSVP Event Site ðŸŽ‰

## Description

This **RSVP Event Site** is a web application built as the final project for CodePathâ€™s Web101 course.

Upon successful submission, the user's details are added to a dynamic participant list, and a friendly confirmation modal with an animated image pops up.
